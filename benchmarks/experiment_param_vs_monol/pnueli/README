I used original pnueli arbiter spec from parameterized folder.
Parameterized PARTY applies strengthenings -- for example, 
it removes liveness assumptions for safety guarantees.
But I don't do that for comparison (sorry, was lazy a bit) with other tools. 
Partly because Unbeast does not support (a1->g1) & (a2->g2) specs.

Another strengthening - localization - makes the spec unrealizable 
in non-parameterized case, and therefore not applied too.
