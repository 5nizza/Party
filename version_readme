This is the state of the tree just after the submission.

PARTY has the modifications:
- accepts previous models -- with --previous <smt2 model file>
  (needs format: nof_states\n then function models with _old postfix)
- direct encoding of gr1 semantics on smt level (parsed the ltl and identifies it)
- probably nothing else but p_bosy with --opt sync_hub --weakag works.
